LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application.

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support.

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\n\n  * Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\n\n  * Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\n\n  * Model Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n  * Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\n\n  * Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, weâ€™d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and weâ€™ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\nnext\n\nQuickstart Guide\n\n__\n\n__Contents\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Modules\n  * Use Cases\n  * Reference Docs\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\nÂ© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.  \n\nLast updated on Apr 19, 2023.  \n\n",

LangChain#\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language\nmodels. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will\nnot only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\n  * _Be data-aware_ : connect a language model to other sources of data\n\n  * _Be agentic_ : allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\n\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely\nconceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see\nhere.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using\nLangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\n  * Getting Started Documentation\n\n## Modules#\n\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each\nmodule we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs,\nand conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\n  * Models: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\n\n  * Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\n\n  * Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\n  * Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n\n  * Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\n  * Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n## Use Cases#\n\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides\nguidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases\nLangChain supports.\n\n  * Autonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n\n  * Agent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.\n\n  * Personal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n\n  * Question Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n\n  * Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\n\n  * Querying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\n\n  * Code Understanding: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.\n\n  * Interacting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\n\n  * Extraction: Extract structured information from text.\n\n  * Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\n\n  * Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n## Reference Docs#\n\nAll of LangChainâ€™s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation\non all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for\nLangChain.\n\n  * Reference Documentation\n\n## LangChain Ecosystem#\n\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\n  * LangChain Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Resources#\n\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your\napplication!\n\n  * LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\n\n  * Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\n\n  * Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain.
